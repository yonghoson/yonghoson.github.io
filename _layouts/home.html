<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About Me</h3>
<p>
    I am currently an undergraduate student in the department of computer science at the State University of New York, Korea and expect to graduate in December '21. I have developed an academic background in AI, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision throughout senior year. My professional experience during undergrad has been in the software company called Smart Radar System Inc. I have developed a human posture detection system based on point clounds information generated from the 4D imaging radar.

    My research interest focuses on (1) developing <b>vision and odometry based novel analytical methods</b> that enhances autonomous vehicle navigation and guidance, (2) designing and validating <b>artificial intelligence</b> systems that can aid <b>contextual safety</b> and <b>intuitive interaction</b> between the driver and the vehicle.
    More broadly, I am keenly interested in how technology can improve ways in which autonomous vehicles to reach SAE level 5 of driving automation.
